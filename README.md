## 🔍 Overview

This project implements and compares different control strategies for a double pendulum system. The double pendulum is a classic example in robotics and control theory, demonstrating complex nonlinear dynamics and serving as a benchmark for various control algorithms.

The implementation includes:
- Complete dynamics modeling of the double pendulum system
- Trajectory generation and planning
- Multiple control strategies (PID, PD with gravity compensation, Inverse dynamics)
- Both joint space and operational space control
- Comprehensive simulation and visualization tools
